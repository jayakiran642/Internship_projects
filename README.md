##1.Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Description
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python, where you compete against the computer. You have 3 chances to lose the game, and the goal is to score as many points as possible before using up all your chances.

Game Rules
You will have 3 chances to lose the game.
Enter:
R for Rock
P for Paper
S for Scissors
Q to Quit the game
The computer will randomly choose one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
You score a point for winning a round, as follows:
Paper beats Rock.
Scissors beat Paper.
Rock beats Scissors.
If you input something invalid, a message will be displayed, and you will be reminded of the game rules.
Once you lose 3 times or decide to quit, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
How to Play
Run the script in your Python environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input your choice (R, P, S, or Q).
Keep track of your score and enjoy!

#2.Number Guessing Game
Description
This is a simple Number Guessing Game built in Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the game will provide feedback on whether the guess was too low or too high. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

How the Game Works
The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player inputs a guess.
The game tells the player whether their guess is:
"Think of a number greater than this" (guess is too low).
"Think less than this number" (guess is too high).
The player keeps guessing until they get the correct number.
Once the correct number is guessed, the game ends with a "Congrats! You won the game" message.

#3.Snake Game
This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a snake that grows in length each time it eats food. The goal is to prevent the snake from colliding with itself or going out of bounds (screen wrapping is implemented for this version).

Features
Classic Snake game mechanics.
Screen wrapping: the snake reappears on the opposite side of the screen when it goes off one edge.
Responsive controls using the keyboard.
Randomly placed food on the screen for the snake to eat and grow.
Game resets upon self-collision.
How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
The snake grows in length when it eats food (red circles).
The game continues indefinitely unless the snake runs into itself, at which point the game resets.

#4.Basic Calculator
This is a basic calculator implemented in Python that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on any number of inputs. The user can enter as many numbers as they want, and the program will perform the selected operation.

Features
Addition: Sum all the numbers provided.
Subtraction: Subtract all subsequent numbers from the first number.
Multiplication: Multiply all the provided numbers.
Division: Divide the first number by all subsequent numbers sequentially (with handling for division by zero).
How to Use
The program prompts the user to select an operation: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, or Exit.
The user is then asked to input numbers separated by spaces.
The program will perform the chosen operation and display the result.
The program runs continuously until the user selects the exit option.
