##Number Guessing Game
Description
This is a simple Number Guessing Game built in Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the game will provide feedback on whether the guess was too low or too high. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

How the Game Works
The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player inputs a guess.
The game tells the player whether their guess is:
"Think of a number greater than this" (guess is too low).
"Think less than this number" (guess is too high).
The player keeps guessing until they get the correct number.
Once the correct number is guessed, the game ends with a "Congrats! You won the game" message.
